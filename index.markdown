Hello and welcome! My name is Luciano.

I’m a writer of film, video games, and fiction, and have been so for as long as I can remember.

I’m specialized in interactive and video game narrative, but have a deep love for storytelling in all its variants, having written in several formats and media both in English and Spanish. 

Right now, I’m living in Los Angeles, California.

On this site, you can check out my portfolio and my resume. If you want to contact me, please feel free to do so.
