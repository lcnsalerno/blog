Hi! I'm Luciano, a video game writer and screenwriter. 

Throughout the various shifts in interests and activities I've experienced in life, writing has been the one constant. I've never stopped writing, and I likely never will.

Writing for film is a lifelong passion of mine, and as such, my academic background is in Screenwriting (UNA, Buenos Aires, and UCLA, Los Angeles).

After discovering video game writing as a professional path, I committed myself to this field. I've written for major, commercially successful companies like Wooga, Crazy Maple Studio, and The Other Guys, as well as collaborated on a range of independent and experimental projects. You can explore all of these in the tabs above.

I'm currently based in Los Angeles, California.
