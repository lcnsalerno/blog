Characters are not a compendium of attributes and traits. This is what I was told years ago when I started pitching a character by describing how they were personality-wise (something like "extremely intelligent but insecure, lonely, tough", and so on). We're supposed to care about characters only in relationship to their conflict, so instead of describing how a character is in the abstract, a character should be defined almost as a logline: it's a human that, given certain background, has to overcome such and such obstacle. 

Once again, conflict is paramount, even when building characters. Hence, relationships and arcs as the most important thing to be developed when writing any kind of character. Is this really so, or is this just the Screenwriting school approach? Why can't we just build a really solid character, in fact a compendium of attributes, and then see what kind of story naturally builds around them?

Lajos Egri, in *The Art of Dramatic Writing*, describes a series of attributes that should be taken into consideration in order to create tridimensional characters. These are broken down in three sections: Physiology (which includes biological gender, age, color of hair and eyes, ethnicity, general appearance, etc.); Sociology (class, education, occupation, religion, etc.); and Psychology (frustrations, temperament, ambitions, personality, IQ).
