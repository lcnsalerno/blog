I've been working as a video game writer since 2016. Interactive writing has been a huge source of inspiration for me, and I find the game development scene, with its constant strive for innovation, the most exciting place for my craft.

These are the most relevant projects I've worked on:

- [Neighbors](#neighbors)
- [Chapters: Interactive Stories](#chapters-interactive-stories)
- [Buenos Aires Tokio](#buenos-aires-tokio)
- [Full-Time Job](#full-time-job)
- [Zoe: Interactive Story](#zoe-interactive-story)

## Neighbors

Visual Novel. Release date TBD.

<p align="left">

</p> 

### About the project

- *Neighbors* is a Visual Novel set during the Salem Witch Trials of 1692.
- Based on both the true events and Arthur Miller's *The Crucible*, I chose interactive media to retell the story in first person, making player choices deeply conflictive in ethical and moral terms.
- In this project, I was not only the writer but also the owner and creator. I led a team of two artists that created all the original art, and I implemented the writing and the animations using Naninovel and Unity.

## Chapters: Interactive Stories

### About the project

- *Chapters*, by Crazy Maple Studio, is a top-grossing interactive fiction app that releases episodic stories on a weekly basis.
- I was the main writer in 10+ stories, writing linear and branching dialogue, descriptions, thought-bubbles, and non-dialogue text, as well as free and premium CYOA-style player choices.
- "*Luciano was fantastic to work with, especially during one of my first projects as a Narrative Designer. He always turned scripts in early, which helped overall with our pipeline, and those scripts were consistently polished and professional. In terms of writing, Luciano has a great sense of pacing and plot, especially when it comes to the outline. He was also communicative about any needed changes and was, all in all, a delight to work with. I would recommend Luciano in a heartbeat!*" (Megan Hoins, Narrative Designer at Crazy Maple Studio).

## Buenos Aires Tokio

Interactive chronicle. Web.

<p align="left">

</p> 

### About the project

- *Buenos Aires Tokio* is an interactive chronicle based on the autobiographic story of my relationship with Franklin Bassarsky, my first game of go teacher.
- In this project, I explored the fragmentary nature of the past by attempting its reconstruction through traces and only traces, with no other narrative thread than a series of maps that put them together.
- I also put to test the idea of maps as interactive storytelling devices, recreating the cities of Buenos Aires and Tokyo in two pixel-art pieces commissioned to recreate the feel of the games of my childhood and using those maps as scenario for the story reconstruction.
- Created with the support of the National Arts Fund of Argentina.

## Full-Time Job

Text adventure. Itch.io.

<p align="left">
<img src="/content_assets/videogames/fulltimejob.jpg" width="500">
</p> 

### About the project

- In *Full-Time Job*, I compiled stories of informal work situations from both my own experiences and volunteers that provided theirs. I used those stories to create a text adventure in which the goal is to get a full-time job with benefits, and where the bosses and interviewers are the game bosses of the adventure.
- The game was played by nearly 2,000 people since launch, and it resonated with an audience used to dealing with abusive work situations and the hardships of the world of work.
- I created the game entirely on Twine and commissioned original art for each of the bosses, making this my first experience authoring a fully-fledged game.

## Zoe: Interactive Story

</p> 

### About the project

- Zoe is an interactive series about a teenage witch, that has achieved a 4.6 score and 2.6K ratings on iOS and a 4.4 score and 123K ratings on Android.
- As a part of a writing team that consisted of a total of five writers, my tasks included the development and design of the plot of each of the five seasons. Also, I was in charge of outlining each of the 120 episodes of the series, along with designing the free and premium player choices in all of them. 
- Part video game, part animated TV show, this project provided me ample experience in a writer's room-like environment as well as in episodic writing, which proved extremely useful in my career ever since.
