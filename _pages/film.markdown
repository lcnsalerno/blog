I've worked on several film projects as a screenwriter, some of them produced and some not. The film industry varies wildly in every part of the world and each particular project, so all my experiences have been radically different from one another. 

Here are some of the screenplays that I wrote and the most memorable projects I was a part of:

- [Inland](#inland)
- [High Press](#high-press)
- [The Tennis *Racket*](#the-tennis-racket) 
- [Ciudad Oculta](#ciudad-oculta) 
- [Moheda](#moheda) 
- [Eldorado](#eldorado)
- [Berlín](#berlín)

### Logline

In 1870, a worn out Colonel leads an expedition beyond the frontier to convince the native people of Patagonia to sell their land, as a last attempt to avoid a massacre.

### About the project

- Awarded 1st prize at the Screenwriting award [*Todos los Tiempos el Tiempo*](https://todoslostiempos.org/2023/11/22/fueron-anunciados-los-ganadores-de-la-edicion-2023/) (2023).
- A Patagonic western based on Argentine literature's classic *An Expedition to the Ranquel Indians* by Lucio V. Mansilla, and inspired by the works of John Ford, Ángel Della Valle, and Cormac McCarthy, *Inland*--Tierra Adentro is a screenplay born of a deep conviction of what Argentine cinema can be.

</p>

### Logline

In 1994, a stagnant entertainment executive has to get in touch with his roots to accomplish the mission of creating a brand new team for the upcoming Major Soccer League. 

### About the project

- Screenplay written during the Professional Program in Screenwriting, UCLA (2021-2022).
- The project was a huge challenge for me, in which I delved into a subject I knew almost nothing about to use it as a vehicle for deeper themes such as a identity and race. 
- I worked with a group of characters that functioned in close relation to the lead and each other, which allowed me to explore character relationships in a way I had not done it before.
- During this experience I got to write a type of film that I very much enjoy watching, following some of my all-time favorite sport movies, such as *Moneyball* and *Jerry Maguire*.

</p>

### Logline

A tennis player past his prime loses his last sponsor and gets involved in a shady deal to stay in the game. 

### About the project

- Screenplay written during the Professional Program in Screenwriting, UCLA (2021-2022).
- The project explores subjects such as identity, frustration, sports ethics, the city of Los Angeles, and the strive for success. 
- This was a very intimate, rich writing experience for me, in which I was able to delve deep into one character and infuse him with my own experiences of being a South American immigrant living in Los Angeles.
- *The Tennis Racket* was also a great opportunity to explore the sports epic sub-genre and experiment with it.

## Ciudad Oculta

Feature. Drama. 2024. Co-written with Francisco Bouzas.

<p align="left">
<img src="/content_assets/film/ciudad_oculta.jpg" width="500">
</p>

### Logline

A young *murguero* with a panic disorder is summoned by his recently-deceased friend to come to his aid, which prompts him to find a way to descend into the world of the dead.

### About the project

- *Ciudad Oculta* premiered at [Berlin Critics' Week 2024](https://wochederkritik.de/en_US/city-lights/).
- Writing this screenplay posed an interesting challenge: starting from the idea of shooting in the slum Ciudad Oculta with non-professional actors who mostly play themselves, in what would be a fiction permanently intertwined with reality, we set out to build a fully genre-based, classic story, weaving a dream with the fabric of reality.
- Along with Francisco Bouzas, co-writer and director, we drew from the Orpheus myth and *The Wizard of Oz*, bringing classics of Western culture, which pretty much shape our view of the world, into a story deeply rooted in the Buenos Aires slums.

## Moheda

Short film. Documentary. 2022. Credited as Additional Writing.

<p align="left">
<img src="/content_assets/film/moheda.jpg" width="500">
</p>

### Logline

A filmmaker travels to Sweden looking for the site of the refugee camp where his parents lived in exile during the last dictatorship in Argentina.

### About the project

- *Moheda* was produced in 2021 with the support of Le Fresnoy Studio National Des Arts Contemporains (France).
- The biggest challenge in this project was the most interesting thing about it: working with the personal archive of the director and author of the film, which involved listening to hours of taped voice mail sent by his parents in exile during the 70s and early 80s to their family in Argentina. Building a story out of an eight-year-long stream of voice messages was unlike anything else I've ever done before.
- The opportunity of helping another author bring their vision to reality was also invaluable. Part of what I had to do, aside from bringing structure to the voices from the archives, was putting emotional distance between the source material and the author. Being the son of the main characters, it was nearly impossible for him to do so on his own, so I'm very grateful for having been let into such an intimate experience.

</p>

### Logline

A young student travels to the jungle town of Eldorado in search of his best friend who went missing there years ago, only to find that a place built upon false promises is not a place where things are easily found.

### About the project

- *Eldorado* was produced with the support of the National Film Institute of Argentina (INCAA). 
- This was the first project in which I collaborated with filmmaker Francisco Bouzas. Started when we were only freshmen university students, we worked on it for nearly a decade of drafts until we reached the final draft used in production. This long process taught me a lot about writing, filmmaking, and time.
- Screenplay in competition for Best Original Screenplay at the International New Latin American Film Festival La Habana 2014.

## Berlín

Short film. Drama. 2016. Credited as Writer and Director.

<p align="left">
<img src="/content_assets/film/berlin.jpg" width="500">
</p>

### Logline

On the eve of a move abroad, two friends wait for an order at a barbecue restaurant, knowing full well that the wait is all the time they have left together.

### About the project

- Premiered at Buenos Aires Festival Internacional de Cine Independiente (BAFICI) in 2016 and awarded Special Mention of the Jury.
- I wrote and directed this project, leading a team of +10 people and directing professional actors in what was an amazing independepent film production experience.
- I wanted to tell a story in the most minimalistic way possible. Knowing the restrictions of our budget and general production conditions, I knew that having minimal cast and only one location and scene would be the best way to do it.
- Inspired by Ozu's long, significant scenes between two characters, I tried to work with subtext, character goals, and silences.
