I"%<p>Writer of film, video games, and fiction.</p>

<p>Throughout all the shifts in interests and activities Iâ€™ve gone through in my life, writing is the only thing that has remained constant. I have never stopped writing. I probably never will.</p>

<p>Writing for film is a lifelong passion of mine, and as such, my academic background is in Screenwriting (UNA, Buenos Aires, and UCLA, Los Angeles).</p>

<p>Years ago I discovered video game writing as a professional path, and being a big video game enthusiast I devoted myself to interactive narrative. I have written professionally for both commercial video games in the mobile scene and independent, experimental projects.</p>

<p>I live in Los Angeles, California.</p>
