<p>Lately I’ve been completely immersed in the so-called classic story structure in screenwriting and narrative: the three-act structure. Attributed to Aristotle based on his principle of stories having a beginning, middle, and end, this structure was actually popularized by Syd Field in 1979 through his book <em>Screenplay</em>, in which he also introduces the concept of plot points, basic to the now “classic” concept of narrative structures.</p>
