I"d<p>Hello and welcome! My name is Luciano.</p>

<p>I’m a writer of film, video games, and fiction, and have been so for as long as I can remember.</p>

<p>I’m specialized in interactive and video game narrative, but have a deep love for storytelling in all its variants, having written in several formats and media both in English and Spanish.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m living in Los Angeles, California.</p>
