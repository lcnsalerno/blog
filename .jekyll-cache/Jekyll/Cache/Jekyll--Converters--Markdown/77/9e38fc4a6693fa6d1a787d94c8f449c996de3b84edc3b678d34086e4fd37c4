<p><em>The Last of Us Part II</em> ends with a sequence that flirts with horror and is, like many other sequences in the game, unapologetically morbid. Ellie, the main character whose growth weâ€™ve witnessed since she was thirteen years old in <em>The Last Of Us</em>â€”and by the way, one could make a case that this Ellie is a different character altogether from that other one, with very few things in commonâ€”, finds Abby, her enemy, and forces her to fight to the death by threatening to slit her adopted siblingâ€™s throat.</p>
